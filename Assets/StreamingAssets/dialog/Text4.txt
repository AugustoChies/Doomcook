Whoa! Hello there! We can't talk for long right now. I'm helping to control these forest fires.
The cause of the fires are, you guessed it, monsters. Ones made entirely of fire actually.
They don't eat your everyday food, seems they'll only eat burnt food, they have a keen taste for ashes.
Here's a tip. Right now you may have enough renown to get a TurboBurner 5000. It's particularly useful here.
Welp, gotta go! Bye!
