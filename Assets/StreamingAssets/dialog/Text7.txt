Hello there Captain Keno...Cook. I meant Captain Cook hehehe.
Anyway. You're getting really close to our base but the number of monsters is also getting bigger around here. Hey you're getting famous! I think they actually really like your food.
That means you'll have to work harder. I hope you already got the hang of it.
I need to go. There is a lot of interference here for some reason.
