Hello there Captain Cook! That's..... a superhero name I made up for you. Well, I can't really hear you but I hope you like it.
So, there is a new species around here. And they are quite difficult to deal with.
I heard people saying they look very similar to a fantasy creature from a game or something. I don't really remember the name, but believe it was called a Mind Slayer or something close to that.
Let's roll with this name. It's fitting because they will slay your mind. They launch psychic attacks that affect your brain and leave you dazed for some time. Don't let them do that.
Their taste is also more sophisticated than usual. You'll have to work harder on their dishes.
Don't get your mind slain! Bye!
