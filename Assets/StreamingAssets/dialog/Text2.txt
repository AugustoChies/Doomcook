Hey there! Doug here!
So, you probably noticed all the hole filled dirt mounds around here, well, it's hard not to notice.
Well, they were made by giant meat eating moles. And don't let their stubby little legs trick you, they're faster than what you're used to.
They also like to travel underground, so you won't be able to stop them with obstacles.
The good news is, it doesn't seem there is any zomboid around this area, so you may focus completely on the monster moles.
Good luck. Doug out.
