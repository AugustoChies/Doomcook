Hello again. Everything going well?
So, about saving you.....
It seems that your cooking attracts monsters to your location. And it's really helping us do our jobs.
So we will have to postpone your rescue a little bit, but don't worry, we're  leaving different "mobile kitchens" around.
I see you've already found one. Move to the next closest one after dealing with each wave of creatures.
Eventually you're going to end up in one of our bases. We'll take you in and you'll be completely safe.
Ah, by the way, there will be 3 lanes from now on, you seem to be drawing more attention from monsters.
Remember, we are still supporting you from the sidelines. Good luck and stay safe!
